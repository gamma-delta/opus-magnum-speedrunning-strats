# How to Speedrun Sigmar's Garden

Sigmar's garden is presented as a careful game of skill, and it might be
if you're trying to be good that the game. But we're not interested in being
good, we're interested in going fast.

The best strategy for Sigmar's Garden (so far) is to just mindlessly click as
fast as you can on any matches you can. Try not borrowing with salt, because
then you have to remember what you borrowed, which requires thinking. This
should be as intellectually stimulating as plain oatmeal.

(Thanks to Lumber Wizard for discovering this strat and making me write this.)
